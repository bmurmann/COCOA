# COCOA: Collaborative Compendium on Analog Integrated Circuits

This open-source book is meant to be a collaborative effort, bringing together insights from students, professionals, and the broader community of analog integrated circuit designers. It will leverage the new possibilities associated with open-source process design kits (PDKs) and open-source chip design software to build up a knowledge base with reproducible examples in a "live and dynamic" online format.

As of its initial creation in August 2024, it is merely a skeleton with the following structure. 

* Part I: Learn to crawl &mdash; Square-law transistors, biasing and small-signal analysis
* Part II: Learn to walk &mdash; Real transistors, noise, mismatch, and distortion
* Part III: Dare to run &mdash; Knowledge base for state-of-the-art circuits
