# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to {{< var title.long >}}.

We aim to make this open-source book a collaborative effort that brings together insights from students, professionals, and the broader community of analog circuit designers.

# Why We Wrote This Book

We're in an age where technology is always evolving. Open collaboration and sharing knowledge are the building blocks of true innovation. That's the spirit behind this effort. We go beyond the traditional textbook model to create a living knowledge hub, so that we can all share and learn from one another.
